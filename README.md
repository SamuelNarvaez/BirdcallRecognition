## Proposal 1: Identifying and Annotating Named Languages in Tweets
### Data: 
Getting Twitter Data in Python Using Tweepy and API Access
### Abstract:

linguistic code-switching (CS), also known as code-mixing, is common among multilingual speakers. The lack of annotated data combined with the high diversity of languages in which this phenomenon can occur makes it difficult to achieve generality in code-switching related NLP tasks. Even though code-switching is largely captured in social media platforms, it is still expensive to annotate a sufficient amount of data for many tasks and languages. Additionally, not all the languages have the same incidence and predominance, making annotations impractical for every combination of languages. Nevertheless, code-switching often occurs in language pairs that include English. I want to explore levaraging English pre-trained models like ELMo or BERT and tailoring them to perform well in code-switching settings. 

### Goals:
* Using Twitter Developer API to pull tweets that engage in translanguaging and code-switching with English language pairs, maybe with a primary focus on the English/Spanish, English/Portuguese language pairs, as I have the most personal experience code-switching in those languages. 
* Experiment with ELMo and BERT for Sequence Tagging, Labling the parts of the tweets that are associated with named languages. 

Something to the effect of :

* Build or find a sufficient labled set to train/test.
