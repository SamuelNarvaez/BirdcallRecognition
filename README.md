## Proposal 1: Identifying and Annotating Named Languages in Tweets
### Data: 
Getting Twitter Data in Python Using Tweepy and API Access
### Abstract:
[Resources on Code Switching](https://github.com/gentaiscool/code-switching-papers)
linguistic code-switching (CS) is a common phenomenon among multilingual speakers. The lack of annotated data combined with the high diversity of languages in which this phenomenon can occur makes it difficult to strive for progress and generality in CS-related Natural Language Proccessing tasks. Even though CS is largely captured in social media platforms, it is still expensive to annotate a sufficient amount of data for many tasks and languages. Additionally, not all the languages have the same incidence and predominance, making annotations impractical and expensive for every combination of languages. Nevertheless, code-switching often occurs in language pairs that include English. I want to explore levaraging English pre-trained models like ELMo or BERT tailored to perform well in code-switching settings.
