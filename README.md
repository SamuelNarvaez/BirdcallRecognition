## Proposal 1: Identifying and Annotating Named Languages in Tweets
### Data: 
Getting Twitter Data in Python Using Tweepy and API Access
### Abstract:
[Resources on Code Switching](https://github.com/gentaiscool/code-switching-papers)


linguistic code-switching (CS) (also known as code-mixing and included in translanguaging) is a common phenomenon among multilingual speakers. The lack of annotated data combined with the high diversity of languages in which this phenomenon can occur makes it difficult to strive for progress and generality in code-switching related NLP tasks. Even though code-switching is largely captured in social media platforms, it is still expensive to annotate a sufficient amount of data for many tasks and languages. Additionally, not all the languages have the same incidence and predominance, making annotations impractical for every combination of languages. Nevertheless, code-switching often occurs in language pairs that include English. I want to explore levaraging English pre-trained models like ELMo or BERT and tailoring them to perform well in code-switching settings. Code-mixing is extremely prevalent in all multilingual societies. Current studies have shown that as much as 20% of user generated content from some geographies, like South Asia, parts of Europe, and Singapore, are code-mixed.

### Goals:
* Using Twitter Developer API to pull tweets that engage in translanguaging and code-switching,
* Experiment with ELMo and BERT for
