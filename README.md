## Proposal 1: Identifying and Annotating Named Languages in Tweets
### Data: 
Getting Twitter Data in Python Using Tweepy and API Access
### Abstract:

linguistic code-switching, also known as code-mixing, is common among multilingual speakers. The lack of annotated data combined with the high diversity of languages in which this phenomenon can occur makes it difficult to achieve generality in code-switching related NLP tasks. Even though code-switching is largely captured in social media platforms, it is still expensive to annotate a sufficient amount of data for many tasks and languages. Additionally, not all the languages have the same incidence and predominance, making annotations impractical for every combination of languages. Nevertheless, code-switching often occurs in language pairs that include English. I want to explore levaraging English pre-trained models like ELMo or BERT and tailoring them to perform well in code-switching settings. 

### Goals:
* Using Twitter Developer API to pull tweets that engage in translanguaging and code-switching with English language pairs, maybe with a primary focus on the English/Spanish, English/Portuguese language pairs, as I have the most personal experience code-switching in those languages. 
* Experiment with ELMo and BERT for Sequence Tagging, Labling the parts of the tweets that are associated with named languages. 

Something to the effect of (Although hopefully more beautiful than):

* Build or find a sufficient labled set to train/test.

## Proposal 2: Squeezr, a Dashbord for community organizing
### Data: 
Stock Market API, something like [AlphaVantage](https://www.alphavantage.co)
### Abstract:
In 2019, the strip-mall fixture GameStop lost almost $500 million. In 2020, a pandemic forcibly shut down many of its stores and gutted its revenue. As of January 10, 2021 nine brokerages had set the one-year target stock price for GameStop at about $10. But thatâ€™s not where it would stay. It climbed in price because a subreddit, r/WallStreetBets, engineered a short squeeze. One hedge fund, Melvin Capital Management, has lost at least $2 billion
### Goals:
* Find squeezes happening now
* Find stocks with the largest short positions
* Present the stocks with the most short vulnerability in a dashboard that is clear and accessible to facilitate community organizing on the scale of r/WallStreetBets with GME to engineer more short squeezes and take down more hedge funds.
